# TO-DO-LIST
To-Do List is a front-end mini project that enables users to add daily tasks, prevents empty or duplicate entries, mark tasks as completed, and delete them when finished. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it stores tasks in Local Storage so data remains after refresh and provides a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
